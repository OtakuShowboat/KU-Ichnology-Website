        Born December 12, 1962, Rochester, New York (U.S. Citizen);

        "font-size:13px; font-weight:bold;">Research
        Interests</span><span style="font-size:13px;"><br />
        I study organism-media interactions and their implications
        for paleontology, sedimentology, stratigraphy,
        paleoenvironments, paleoecology, paleopedology,
        paleohydrology, and paleoclimate. My main research focuses
        on interactions in the continental realm, where organism
        activity relates to the history of the soil formation and
        the record of paleobiodiversity not recorded by body
        fossils in deposits where they are lacking. My interests
        include the distribution of trace fossils in the
        continental realm, evolution of organism behavior,
        evolution of continental ecosystems, the interpretation of
        past climates from paleosols, and effects of extinctions on
        soil biota and their recovery. My research has led to me to
        study a wide variety of organisms and their behavior, from
        microorganisms to dinosaurs and mammals. Past research I
        have conducted has extended the fossil record of several
        organisms, including crayfish, ants, termites, bees and
        wasps, mammals, and dermestids. Check the current research
        page for more information regarding specific research
        projects. I lead the multidisciplinary research group IBGS
        (IchnoBioGeoSciences), which works with several different
        departments here at KU and at other universities around the
        globe.
