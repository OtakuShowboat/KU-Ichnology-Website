		<span style="font-size:13px;">This
        study documented the tracemaking ability of vinegaroons
        (whip scorpions). Vinegaroons are organisms related to
        scorpions, except they lack a stinging tail and their first
        set of walking limbs are modified into antennae-like
        structures. Experiments were performed in nine trials of
        varying grain size and moisture settings. Trackways were
        found to be preserved better in settings that were dry and
        fine-grained, with the preservation potential of trackways
        decreasing as the media became coarser and wetter.
        Individual tracks were oblong to striate and were arranged
        in triangular patterns. It is hoped that this research will
        be used to identify fossil vinegaroon trackways, which have
        been previously undescribed in the fossil record. Research
        in this venue is on going as the trackways and behaviors of
        a variety of arthropods have yet to be documented in
        detail.
