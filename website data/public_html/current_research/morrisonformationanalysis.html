        paleoenvironmental analysis of the Morrison
        Formation:</span>
		<br />
		<span style="font-size:13px;">Our group
        currently is conducting several research projects on the
        Morrison Formation. The first is an ongoing research
        project cataloging the diversity of trace fossils preserved
        in the Morrison Formation. The preliminary efforts of this
        research are presented in Hasiotisâ€™s 2004 paper,
        Reconnaissance of Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation
        ichnofossils, which you can find here. The second is on the
        taphonomy and paleoenvironment of the Morrison Formation in
        the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. The field area in this study
        is highly fossiliferous, containing numerous Camarasaur
        bones and Allosaur teeth in a weakly developed paleosol. It
        was determined from this evidence that this deposit is the
        remains of a scavenging event by several juvenile and few
        adult Allosaurs. Further sedimentologic analysis
        demonstrates that the area was a poorly drained environment
        with high input from volcanic systems. It was determined
        that the strongest paleoenvironmental control on this
        system was volcanic activity rather than climate change.
        The last project is an integrated study of the Morrison
        Formation using ichnology, paleopedology, and geochemistry.
        A chemostratigraphic profile showing the variation of
        organic carbon with paleoclimate will be developed for the
        Upper Morrison Formation near Ticaboo, Utah. Research is on
        going.
