		<span style=
        "font-size:13px;">This comprehensive study of the trace
        fossils found in the Willwood Formation in the Bighorn
        Basin of Northern Wyoming, was used to reconstruct the
        paleoecology and paleoclimate of the region during the
        Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). The PETM was a
        rapid, high magnitude warming event that persisted for only
        tens of thousands of years, but it had a tremendous effect
        on the environment in the Bighorn Basin. The trace fossil
        assemblages found during PETM demonstrate that transient
        warming created dry conditions and well-drained soils,
        whereas the soils after the PETM were poorly drained as a
        result of wetter climatic conditions. Trace fossils overall
        were larger during the PETM, suggesting that climate has a
        strong effect on the body size of burrowing arthropods.
        This research also resulted in the erection of a new
        ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Naktodemasis bowni, which is a
        type of adhesive meniscate burrow found in well-drained
        soils. Research is on going as numerous trace fossils have
        yet to be taxonomically assigned and more materials and new
        relationships between trace fossils and paleosols are being
        found.
