This is meant to log changes made to the KU Ichnology website from when it was first downloaded through the term of my employment.

The website is meant primarily as a catalogue of known ichnogenera, with valuable information about each trace. You know, because asking graduate students to actually do research to find out about trace fossils is like asking a cat to do pretty much anything without some sort of reward.
The website was very simple, coded primarily with HTML, CSS, and a very minimal amount of javascript.

The initial state of the site was as follows:

A few stylesheet errors leading to odd glitches in the navbar.
The ENTIRE website had the navbar and footer coded on every single html page - over 800 unique pages.
For some reason, a full clone of the website existed in the Video directory, and a partial older version of the site in the References.
Videos were broken. No video would play in any browser. 5 videos were corrupted. All videos were in .mov format.
Navigation would not link back to index page, but rather a page named page0, an outdated clone of index.
About Us pages were out of date and not reflective of those people who had graduated or dropped from the IBGS program. Some do not have pictures.
Contact page was only linked through the home index page and not in the navbar.
The vast majority of ichnogenera do not have pictures. Many have outdated or incorrect information.
